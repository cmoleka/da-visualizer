/**
* *The graph has the following:
  - vertices, or nodes, denoted in the algorithm by v or u;
  - weighted edges that connect two nodes: (u,v) denotes an edge, and w(u,v) denotes its weight.

* *This is done by initializing three values:

  - dist, an array of distances from the source node s to each node in the graph, initialized the following way: dist(s) = 0; and for all other nodes v, dist(v) = infinity. This is done at the beginning because as the algorithm proceeds, the dist from the source to each node v in the graph will be recalculated and finalized when the shortest distance to v is found

  - Q, a queue  of all nodes in the graph. At the end of the algorithm's progres, Q will be empty.

  - S, an empty set, to indicate which nodes the algorithm has visited. At the end of the algorithm's run, S will contain all the nodes of the graph.

* *The algorithm proceeds as follows:
  - While Q is not empty, pop the node v, that is not already in S, from Q with the smallest dist (v). In the first run, source node s will be chosen because dist(s) was initialized to 0. In the next run, the next node with the smallest dist value is chosen.

  - Add node v to S, to indicate that v has been visited

  - Update dist values of adjacent nodes of the current node v as follows: for each new adjacent node u,

    - if dist (v) + weight(u,v) < dist (u), there is a new minimal distance found for u, so update dist (u) to the new minimal distance value;

    - otherwise, no updates are made to dist (u).

*  * The algorithm has visited all nodes in the graph and found the smallest distance to each node. dist now contains the shortest path tree from source s.

* !Note: The weight of an edge (u,v) is taken from the value asociated with (u,v) on the graph.
