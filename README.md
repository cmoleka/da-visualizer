# Data Structure & Algo visualization

This project aims to provide a comprehensive visual format to illustrate Data Structures and Algorithms. By doing so, we hope to create an easy-to-follow resource for both novice and experienced users to better understand the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms. Through a series of diagrams, charts, and explanations, the goal is to help individuals gain a better understanding of these topics in a more accessible and visually appealing way.
